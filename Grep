man grep

Basic command line:
grep ‘[regex]’
if matches the regex will print the input. Otherwise won’t

ep comes from the ed (Unix text editor) search command "global regular expression print".
--used when you are looking for text in a document
two other variants: egrep and fgrep

Quantifiers:
* (star): zero or more
+ (star): one or more
? (question mark): optional character, equivalent to {0,1}

Shorthands:
[[:album:]]: \w
[[:space:]]: \s
\W and \S are negation of above


Backreferences:
refer to a match that was made earlier in a regex
\n: backreference specifier, n is a number, looks for nth subexpression


Family Differences:
grep - uses regular expressions for pattern matching
fgrep - file grep, only matches fixed strings but can get search strings from a file
egrep - extended grep, uses a more powerful set of RE but not support back-referencing
