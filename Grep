two other variants: egrep and fgrep

Quantifiers:
* (star): zero or more
+ (star): one or more
? (question mark): optional character, equivalent to {0,1}

Backreferences:
refer to a match that was made earlier in a regex
\n: backreference specifier, n is a number, looks for nth subexpression


Family Differences:
grep - uses regular expressions for pattern matching
fgrep - file grep, only matches fixed strings but can get search strings from a file
egrep - extended grep, uses a more powerful set of RE but not support backreferencing
